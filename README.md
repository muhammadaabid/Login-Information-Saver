# Login-Information-Saver
My First Java Project

This is a java mini project based on GUI, this is a small java application or you may also call it as a java program. This program is mainly developed for file handling. This simple program is used to save your login information like email, username or password. I use Option Panels for Error and Information messages and i also used Dialog Boxes to make an impression of GUI in my small Java GUI based project, as it is my first java project, there may be some error but i try my best. 

This program has one frame and many panels which are;
Main Frame (A JFrame on which all JPanels are displayed as per they are set up)
Create Account Panel (A JPanel for creating Login Information Saver Account)
Login Account Panel (A JPanel for logging in Login Information Saver Account)
Forgot Password Panel (A JPanel for restoring Login Information Saver Account password)
Panel for writting new password after forgotten (A JPanel for setting new password after forgotten)
Change Password Panel (A JPanel for changing Login Information Saver Account password)
Save Data Panel (A JPanel for Saving your login information)
Show Data Panel (A JPanel for Showing your saved login information)

This program also contains one MenuBar having two Menu and all Menu Items are in those two Menu;
Main Menu Bar (This is main JMenuBar having all two JMenu)
First Menu (This JMenu having two JMenuItems which are Create Account and Login Account)
Second Menu (This JMenu having four JMenuItems which are Save Data, Show Data, Change Password and Log Out)
